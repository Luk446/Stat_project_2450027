This folder contains all the python code. Due to its convenience the code is formatted into jupyter notebooks, as they allow for tiered result presenentation and the option to markdowns (text boxes) under code is very useful.
At the beginning of all the notebooks is a detailed explanation of the path taken and the reason behind it, furthermore each line of code is commented for explanation,

The current files that should be present in this folder are:
- cobbangleanalysis.ipnyb

The first analysis we do is based on the cobb angle variable. It can be found in "Cobbangleanlysis.ipynb", in this we perform a hypothesis test with use of a anderson darling test.
