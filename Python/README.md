This folder contains all the python code. Due to its convenience the code is formatted into jupyter notebooks, as they allow for tiered result presentation and the option to markdowns (text boxes) under code is very useful.
At the beginning of all the notebooks is a detailed explanation of the path taken and the reason behind it, furthermore each line of code is commented for explanation,

The files are also avaiable as pdf format in a seperate folder

The current files that should be present in this folder are:
- cobbangleanalysis.ipnyb
- montetest1.ipnyb
- pieandcorr

The first analysis we do is based on the cobb angle variable. It can be found in "Cobbangleanlysis.ipynb", in this we perform a hypothesis test with use of a anderson darling test to investigate the charactersitics of scoliosis in pediatric medicine.

The second analysis computed is a monte carlo test. We want to verify the legitimacy of the results that the paper reported, checking whether they may be found through random generation when parameters are set

The third analysis concerns the generation of important visual aid for demonstrating the patient range and explores another, which we find is a highly correlated, variable
