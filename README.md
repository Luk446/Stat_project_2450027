Python and Solidworks statistical analysis for university year 3 RnD module project. The aim of this project is to perform multiple statistical analysis on a medical prosthetic.

The project is spli into two parts
- Python data analysis using info derived from the paper
- Solidworks 3d modelling
    - We use some python in this section too, utilising the visualisation power of python to describe material analysis

The chosen paper can be found at [https://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/FullText/2005/09011/The_Treatment_of_Spine_and_Chest_Wall_Deformities.11.aspx]

** Brief paper notes **

The objective of the paper is: 
Is VEPTR (Vertical Expandable Prosthetic titanium rib) expansion good for treatment of TIS (Thoracic insufficiency syndrome) associated with fused ribs.
- ET (expansion thoracostomy) and VEPTR were developed to directly control spine and chest deformity during growth

Important parameters measured in the paper are:
- Cobb angle (standard measurement to determine and track the progression of scoliosis)
- Length of Thoracic spine
- CT derived lung volumes
- Pulmonary function tests
    - only in older children

 Cobb angle is deemed to be the 'success' variable as that is the goal of the paper. Cobb angles range can be in an extensive range and response depends on value

 Specific cobb angles (degree)
- approx 10 = minimum for scoliosis
- 15 < X < 20 = low priority
- 20 < X < 40  = medium
- 40+ = spinal intervention required
