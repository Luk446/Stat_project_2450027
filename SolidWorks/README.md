This folder contains no visualisation of the solidworks part of the project. Due to the specificity of displaying models site like grabcad are much more suited. The construction drawings and prints of FEA are all available however. 

The models can be found on my [GrabCad!](https://grabcad.com/luke.edgecombe-2/models)

For this portion of the project. Using surgeon manuals and the paper a replication of the prosthetic was generated.

Once the model was generated
- model is assebmled
- approriate finite element analysis (FEA) acheieved
- link FEA to stresses in the body
- construction drawings with dimension are made

- [Manual](VEPTR_information_sheet.pdf) + [Manual 2](veptter_2_manual.pdf)


The construction drawing sheet demonstrates the individual parts dimesions and the method of assembly through sub-assebmly and exploded views

Several static studies are done to evalaute the material strength of the parts

- In this, a yield strength has been calculated, and shown to be 1,2707 Von mises (N/m^2) A level several magnitudes above what could be generated in a body. An obvious conclusion is the material strength is suitable for this application.
