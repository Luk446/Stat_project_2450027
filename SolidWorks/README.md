This folder contains limited visualisation of the solidworks part of the project. Due to the specificity of displaying models site like grabcad are much more suited. The construction drawings FEA reports are all available however. 

A limited amount of python is performed for this section too and can be found in solidworkspython

The models can be found on my [GrabCad!](https://grabcad.com/luke.edgecombe-2/models)

For this portion of the project. Using surgeon manuals and the paper a replication of the prosthetic was generated.

Once the model was generated
- model is assembled
- approriate finite element analysis (FEA) acheieved
- Visualisation done
- construction drawings with dimension are made

-  assembly manual used for dimensions  [Manual](VEPTR_information_sheet.pdf) + [Manual 2](veptter_2_manual.pdf)


The construction drawing sheet demonstrates the individual parts dimesions and the method of assembly through sub-assebmly and exploded views

The folder study reports contains FEA analysis info.

From this folder we can derive some important information 

First we analyse the extension assembly, in particular a torsion analyisis on the circular face

Next we analyse the screw hook assembly, the hook face is tested.

All info derived is collated and displayed in the notebook "solidworkspython"
