This folder contains no visualisation of the solidworks part of the project. Due to the specificity of displaying models site like grabcad are much more suited. The construction drawings FEA reports are all available however. 

The models can be found on my [GrabCad!](https://grabcad.com/luke.edgecombe-2/models)

For this portion of the project. Using surgeon manuals and the paper a replication of the prosthetic was generated.

Once the model was generated
- model is assebmled
- approriate finite element analysis (FEA) acheieved
- link FEA to stresses in the body
- construction drawings with dimension are made

- [Manual](VEPTR_information_sheet.pdf) + [Manual 2](veptter_2_manual.pdf)


The construction drawing sheet demonstrates the individual parts dimesions and the method of assembly through sub-assebmly and exploded views
